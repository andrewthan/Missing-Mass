This repo contains Python notebooks that implement simulations of missing mass and the WingIt estimator for sticky Markov chains and for text from the novel *A Tale of Two Cities* by Charles Dickens. 

The details are in the following paper:

[PMT24] A. Pananjady, V. Muthukumar, A. Thangaraj, "Just Wing It: Optimal Estimation of Missing Mass in a Markovian Sequence"

The repo contains the text of the novel in the file "TaleofTwoCities.txt". This is downloaded from Project Gutenberg (https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/98) and modified to remove a lot of the auxiliary content. 

The Jupyter notebooks have a link to Google Colab for easy execution.
